 These are functions for producing 32-bit hashes for hash table lookup.
 hashword(), hashlittle(), hashlittle2(), hashbig(), mix(), and final()
 are externally useful functions.  Routines to test the hash are included
 if SELF_TEST is defined.  You can use this free for any purpose.  It's in
 the public domain.  It has no warranty.

 I've modified Bob's hash to be useful in the Linux kernel, and
 any bugs present are my fault.
